            <b>
                If video isn’t already an important part of your content marketing strategy, odds are it’s about to be. Web content is taking a turn toward video whether SEOs and content marketers like it or not. In fact, according to invideo, online videos make up more than 82% of all consumer internet traffic and 79% of people say they’ve been convinced to buy or download a piece of software by watching a video.
                <br>Not an expert? Don’t know how to edit videos, have a video studio, or have a bona fide video specialist to shoot and cut your features? That’s alright! The goal of today’s blog is to show you that with the right video editing software, you too can churn out sleek, professional video content—regardless of experience—and keep your content strategy ahead of the curve.

                <br>Let’s dive in! Here are our recs for the top best pieces of video editing software or video editing apps for beginners—from cheapest (i.e. free!) to most expensive.

                <br>The best video editing software for beginners in 2022
                <br>Here is a list of the best video editing software for beginners in 2022:

                <br>Apple iMovie
                <br>Lumen5
                <br>Animaker
                <br>Nero Video
                <br>Corel VideoStudio
                <br>Filmora from Wondershare
                <br>CyberLink PowerDirector
                <br>InVideo
                <br>Adobe Premiere Elements
                <br>Pinnacle Studio
                <br>Adobe Premiere Pro
                <br>Apple Final Cut Pro
                <br>1. Apple iMovie
                <br>Ok—so to those of you working with PCs, this one won’t really apply; but we’d be remiss to leave it off the list. If you’re looking for simplicity and elegance, it doesn’t get much better than Apple iMovie. iMovie’s ten high-fidelity filters are some of the classiest in the video editing game; and if you’re shooting on your iPhone, or have been editing a project on your iPad, you can use AirDrop to wirelessly and seamlessly transfer your project over to your Mac.

                <br>One of iMovie’s most coveted features is its green-screen, or “chroma-key” tool, which allows you to place your characters in exotic locations—Hawaii, say—at a moment’s notice. Want to overlay the scene with “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”? iMovie ties directly in with iTunes and GarageBand, so you can easily implement custom tracks and sounds. When your movie’s finally ready to ship, release it into the wild using iMessage, Facebook, YouTube, or any other of iMovie’s succinctly connected platforms.

                <br>Standout Features: Seamless Apple product integration; green-screen; audio and social platform integration
                <br>Pricing: Free with the purchase of a Mac
                <br>Free download: Up your game with our free all-star online advertising playbook.

                <br><br>2. Lumen5
                <br>Lumen5 markets itself as a tool that turns blog posts into social promos. While the process isn’t perfect, and you’ll likely have to do some tinkering to get your blog content looking just the way you want it, the rest of the video creation process is a cinch. Merely refine some copy that teases your blog post; drag and drop some gifs, screengrabs, or video clips; add some music; and your engaging social video will be ripe for Facebook and Twitter.

                <br><br>Standout Features: Blog-to-social-promo creation; drag-and-drop interface
                <br>Pricing: Create as many 720p videos as you want with the free version. Remove the watermark for $11 per month, or upgrade to 1080p for $59 per month.
                <br><br>3. Animaker
                <br>Animaker has its own online video editor that enables anyone to easily create videos from their own videos, photos, text, and audio. Absolutely no video editing experience required. It’s a lightweight app that works in your web browser, so there’s no complex timeline, layers, or complexity. Just an intuitive drag-and-drop experience to tell your stories.
                <br>Standout Features: Lightweight app without a complex timeline, easy drag-and-drop option with real-time collaboration
                <br>Pricing: Starts at $10/mo, goes up to $49/mo
                <br><br>4. Nero Video
                <br>One of the cheaper options around ($49.99), Nero Video holds its own on this list—it comes well-stocked with a lot of the tricks and effects you’ll find among other products vying for video editing supremacy, and as far as software for beginners, you can certainly do worse. If you’re going to spend money learning how to edit videos, however, you might want to steer clear. Nero just doesn’t have the speed and functionality of some of the other products listed here, and if its value proposition is its price, $50 is still not all that cheap.

                <br>Standout Features: Low pricing
                <br>Pricing: One-time payment of $39.95
                <br>5. Corel VideoStudio
                <br>Corel VideoStudio has all the characteristics of the other top-of-the-line products on this list, including 360-degree VR and 4k support, but it also has the distinction of being the first piece of consumer video editing software to offer motion tracking—which, if you’re not already familiar, is a feature that allows you to track specific objects throughout your cut (if you wanted, say, to point an arrow at one of your characters, blur out his face, or bestow him with a funny hat). Most of the products on this list come equipped with motion tracking, but VideoStudio still boasts one of the best motion tracking systems around.

                <br>One of the knocks on VideoStudio is its speed, which lags notably behind some of the faster systems on this list, like CyberLink PowerDirector and Pinnacle Studio. Still: for a one-time payment of $99.99? You can do much worse.

                <br>Standout Features: Motion tracking
                <br>Pricing: One-time payment of $99.99
                <br>6. Filmora from Wondershare
                <br>When it comes to video editing software, Filmora is about as multi-faceted as they come. Filmora is Wondershare’s standard, simple, high-quality video editing offering; but Wondershare also offers FilmoraGo (for mobile editing) and Filmora Scrn (for screen recording and editing). The design is intuitive and easy to use, and comes replete with filters, overlays, motion elements, transitions, and a small selection of royalty-free music. Here are a few more of the “basics” Filmora offers:
