The heart of Mumbai has some of the best and beautiful colonial architecture and if you venture out to the lesser known lanes, you will also come across several distinct bazaars, temples, fancy restaurants and a nightlife that is one of its kinds. Before Mumbai became the city hat it is now, it was a collection of seven islands which was eventually formed to form Bombay. It was given to the British as dowry to Charles II who married Catherine of Braganza. The island city that Mumbai is today is owing to these reclamation and these islands were home to several fishing colonies. The British made Mumbai an important port since it was already had a natural harbor but it rose to its richness during the American Civil War when cotton supplies were completely stopped from America to Britain. India made the most of this situation and it is said that traders earned approximately 80 million pounds which is a lot of money. This made way for Bombay’s very own merchant traders who were rich. As you walk around in the many lanes of South Bombay you will still get to witness the remnants of this city’s glorious past. Cotton factories and many buildings that are dilapidated are still to be seen scattered around many parts of Mumbai, especially South Mumbai. Apart from this, another every interesting par about this city is that in spite of the several unfortunate incidents and acts of terrorism this city has seen, it still moves on and lives with the same love for Mumbai.

It is also called as the Queen’s Necklace and it is called so, because of the long stretch that lights up at night and looks similar to a pearl necklace. The whole promenade is flanked beautifully with palm trees. The best time to visit Marine drive is at night when there is comparatively lesser crowd and there is a distinct peace you feel at that time. The cool breeze, the flowing waves and the lights all makes the feel of sitting here a beautiful one. There would be hardly anybody disturbing you and your moments of solitude, except for the tea vendors that sell hot cups of tea and even coffee till late night. The Marine drive begins at Nariman point to end at Juhu and Girgaum.

                <br>Haji Ali
                <br>Haji Ali Dargah is one of the most renowned and revered mausoleums of the country. Situated in Worli, the Haji Ali Dargah is located in the middle of an island and that’s one of the many reasons that make this place so attractive. Haji Ali is another very important landmark of Mumbai and it is said that this dargah was built in 1431 and it is the mausoleum of Pir Haji Ali Shah who was a Sufi saint. Approximately 30,000 people visit this dargah every week and ad per legends it is said that the Saint had once visited India to spread the teachings of Islam. Before he passed away, he had asked his followers to keep the coffin carrying his dead body into the sea. And today that spot is exactly where the Haji Ali stands. The Dargah has been given an Islamic architecture style and the white domes and the beautiful minarets are examples of the same. Mughal style architecture is one of the best and also a pleasing to the eye architecture. The gateway of the Dargah is made of pure marble and also the minarets have been built with white marble. There is an attraction within this attraction and that is the beautiful Qawwali Khana where they hold Qawwali recitals every Friday. The interiors have been done intricately with mirrors and on some portions of the shrine you will also see verses from the Quran written. For those who are believers, they do not really need a reason to visit the Haji Ali Dargah. And for the non believers, the architecture and the scenic location serves as a good reason to visit this divine place. And on Ed, the relics of Prophet Muhamed are put on for public display.
