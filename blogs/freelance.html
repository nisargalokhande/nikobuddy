            <b>
               <br> If you are new to freelancing and want to know what freelance jobs are and what is freelancing, this blog is for you. Consider it your go-to guide to freelancing. As more and more things are moving to an online platform, we’ll majorly focus on how to begin your online journey working from home. Yes, that’s possible. This article consists of steps that you should follow if you want to become a freelancer, and trust us; you can be one! 

               <br>But first, what is freelancing?
               <br>In the whole employee vs entrepreneur world, freelancing is a different way to work. Consider it as a mid-way. Freelancers are self-employed people who don’t work at a particular company but a lot of them. Sounds interesting. Doesn’t it? A freelancer is hired for a specific project, service, or task by the client (or conventionally the employer). 

               <br>A freelancer works on a variety of projects at the same time but for different clients. In a freelance job, one has to manage their priorities, time, and workload and do their taxes. That might feel like a lot to handle, but there is no feeling like being your boss. A freelancer can work from anywhere globally, and in given times, it mainly involves working from home.

               <br>If you are wondering what roles freelancers play, the answer is almost everything. You can choose any field as a freelancer from services like writing, editing, consultancy, marketing, designing, ICT, virtual administration, social media management, etc. Often freelancers are experts in their respective domains and work independently. However, they can also work in person.

               <br>Not sure where to start? Don’t worry!
               <br>Now, as you know what is freelancing, let’s see how to get into it. If you are a complete beginner, you need to recognize your skills and advertise your services to your existing network- friends, family, college alumni, etc. As they trust you and are more likely to hire you, you can get some jobs, which will help you build a resume and a portfolio. Along with that, you will also have some testimonials. It is known as building your reputation, which is the most important part of the freelancing world.

               <br>The next step is acquiring clients. In 2021, it is essential to have an online presence to sell your services. You have to start building a personal brand to generate leads. Take help from existing platforms such as LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, etc. 

               <br>Put out content that shows that you are an expert in your domain. Have a blog or website showcasing your work, and don’t forget to be creative. If this is not your thing, find what medium you are comfortable in and attract your target audience. Search for freelance jobs on LinkedIn, and don’t forget to network. Approach prospective clients and show them your work.

               <br>Another way is to sign up for a freelancing website. There are plenty of them, and you can search and start applying for jobs that you are fit for. These sites have a customer base that is always looking for freelancers. 

               <br>Tip: Look for niche sites that you are specialized in rather than general sites, as they often pay better. For example, if you are a UI/UX designer, look for freelancing sites that have a focus on graphic designers rather than signing up on any website.

               <br>Which is the better way to earn? 

               <br>Try and test. Freelancers today use a mix of both personal branding and freelancing websites to earn more than the industry average.

               <br>Skills needed to become a freelancer
               <br>The only prerequisite is to know anything of value. You need to have a skill set that can serve people, and you can be paid for. It can be anything technical or non-technical. Let’s go step by step.

               <br>We might not know, but many of your skills are internet-friendly, such as software development, website development, content writing, video editing, etc. The Internet is flooded with opportunities for skilled people, and this is not going to decrease anytime. 

               <br>For people with thorough British, American, or Australian accents, transcription jobs are available in plenty. You can also work as a voice-over artist in promotional ads and animation videos. Every graphics and animation specialist needs one to make their characters alive.

               <br>For people knowing foreign languages, translation jobs and companies are looking for customer support in Spanish, German, French, and many more languages. For these services, you need not be a techie, and you only require basic computer knowledge.

               <br>Now let’s talk about work that needs computer knowledge. Computer-savvy people have a myriad of options. If you are trained in web designing, graphic design, or software development, you should go for such jobs as these have the highest prospects. Your portfolio matters a lot for such positions.

               <br>If you don’t have technical skills, don’t fret. Most of the work does not require coding skills, such as copywriting, content writing, subject matter creation, etc. These work fields need you to be patient and steadfast because of the high competition.

               <br>Tip: Retain clients that you acquire with your work. You can quickly master MS Excel, MS Word, Data Entry, web scraping, live chat support tasks, and freelance in this zone.

               <br>In the virtual world, experience counts more than in the real world. It will take time to get big clients but keep your resume impressive and keep hunting for projects. You will eventually learn a lot and build your profile.
               <br>While registering on freelancing sites, go through rules and regulations. Be honest in your profile and go only for genuine sites, not the one that asks you to pay beforehand.
               <br>There are so many projects and freelancers out there. So, first, select a project that you believe in while pitching a client, focusing on your USPs, and keeping your applications short.

               <br>Research the standard pricing and make the best possible pitch. Think from an employer’s perspective while sending out applications, and you would surely acquire and retain clients.
               <br>Final Word
               <br>We hope you are now clear on what is freelancing and have an idea of where to start. To summarize it for you better, create a resume, add samples of your service to showcase your experience, promote your services on social media or freelancing websites, make a compelling pitch, and research pricing. Remember, in freelance jobs; you are in charge of everything, the good and the bad. Don’t rush and focus on growing regularly!
