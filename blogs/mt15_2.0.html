The engine works alongside a six-speed transmission with a slip-and-assist clutch.

 

                <br>Yamaha MT-15 Version 2.0 Suspension And Brakes:

                <br>The Yamaha MT-15 Version 2.0 employs the same deltabox frame as its predecessor, but it is linked to an aluminium swingarm instead of a box-section unit.
