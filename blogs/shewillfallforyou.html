                <br>There is no golden formula for making up a broken heart or making a pure heart fall in love with you. But, remember there is no magic love potion either.

                <br>When she is super angry about your behavior or a mistake you’ve made, she needs your love and attention. Make sure to give her plenty of time and show her with words and actions how important she truly is to you.

                <br>Always remember, it’s the “little things” you do often versus the “big things” you do occasionally that provide the most return on investment into your Love Bank Account!

                <br>These techniques and tips will work for all types of relationships and will certainly help her fall in love with you all over again.
                <br>1. Listen to Her
                <br>Women love the man who listens to their issues and concerns and desires without having to fix anything. When you communicate with her, you are already one step ahead. Be open-minded and discuss various options.

                <br>You should only give advice when she asks for it. Be sure to keep the communication open and loving.

                <br>Once she realizes the communication power you give to her, she’ll fall in love with you all over again.

                <br>2. Compliment Her Looks
                <br>Everyone likes good compliments, but women especially love to hear from their partner and not just on birthdays, anniversaries, and Valentine’s Day. Compliments should be sincere, honest, and straightforward.

                <br>While taking this step, do not overdo it. Overdoing compliments can harm you, and result in rejection. So, do it appropriately and frequently and you’ll get rewarded for it handsomely.

                <br>3. Do Not Shy Away from Chivalry
                <br>This is the perfect time to get her attention and keep it. Chivalry is a gentleman’s manner. So, you should be a gentleman to your woman, and treat her like a Queen.

                <br>Little things such as an opening a door for her, pulling out a chair, or giving her your coat in chilly weather will make her feel adored and special.

                <br>When she comes to know the depths of respect you have for her in your heart, you’ll once again be filling the Love Bank Account that will offset your mistakes.

                <br><br>4. Support Her Decisions
                <br>We all desire to be heard and supporting your partner with her decisions is an important step in trust, connection and enhanced love.  Whether it’s something simple like assisting with daily chores and errands or something more important like her career, be fully present with an open mind and ear.

                <br>Supporting decisions does not mean agreeing with everything she says. We can always agree to disagree as long as it’s done without judgement or righteousness.  You must think through her decisions, and communicate rationally about your take on them. You should support her decisions by showing respect and confidence in her. This works magically in the love game.

                <br><br>5. Tell Her How Much You Love Her
                <br>Don’t be shy with your affection.  Too often we “think” we know that our partner loves us simply by being there.  Actions do speak louder than words, but actually telling your partner how much you love her will have her falling in love more deeply.

                <br><br>6. Give Her Attention
                <br>Spending “quality time” time with your partner is one of the most powerful ways to increase desire and to have her fall more deeply in love with you. Find new hobbies and activities to share together.  When speaking with her, put away your phone and be fully present.

                <br><br>7. Nourish the Love between You
                <br>Don’t wait for a special occasion (Birthday, Anniversary, Valentine’s Day, etc.) to shower your love with attention. Bring her flowers just because.  Take her on a surprise date.  Tell her how much she means to you so you’re continually “demonstrating” how special she is to you.  Then see how much she’ll appreciate your efforts.

                <br><br>8. Looking Good
                <br>Except for all the good habits, women are attracted to a handsome man. You should groom yourself a little bit, and look the best version of yourself. You should wear the best clothes, the best glasses, smart watches, and gorgeous shoes. When you look handsome and take pride in your appearance, your girl will fall in love with you all over again.

                <br><br>9. Good Date Ideas
                <br>While trying all of the above techniques, you should plan and share amazing experiences with her.  Women like being pampered. You can search for several amazing date ideas, and enjoy spending some quality time with each other. Creating new and novel experiences together increases the quality of your relationship.

                <br><br>10. Be Funny and Joyful
                <br><br>No one enjoys being around a downer.  When you let your walls down, it allows your woman to enter your world. Find the joy in life being noticing what’s right versus what’s wrong.  Choose to be “happy over being right” in your relationship and watch love flourish!  Nothing is more sexier to a woman than a man that is confident, intelligent, well groomed, and funny.
