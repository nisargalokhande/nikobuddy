                What is Python?
                <br>Python is an interpreted mid-level object-oriented programming language created by Guido van Rossum for Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica in the Netherlands. It was designed to be as easy to read as plain English.

                <br>Since its creation, Python has evolved to become widely used for general applications in web development, software development, and backend system scripting. It has compatibility with nearly every system as a portable language that can be executed on various platforms using the same interface.

                <br>It is one of the most popular languages used across the board by scripters in nearly every industry from scientific research and mathematics to backend web development. It is completely open-source and can be used for a wide variety of applications.

                <br>What is PHP?
                <br>Hypertext Preprocessor, or PHP, is a widely used open-source procedure-oriented scripting language made specifically for web development. It was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. It can generate dynamic page content as well as create, open, write, read, delete, and close server files. It is a very database-friendly language and has built-in functionality to add, delete, or modify data in a database.

                <br>Like Python, PHP is considered one of the easiest scripting languages to learn. However, it can only be used for web development due to its heavy reliance on hypertext.

                <br>Similarities Between Them
                <br>Python and PHP only have a few similarities. As one is an object-oriented language and the other is a procedure-oriented language, there are more differences than similarities. However, they are both heavily used for backend web development.

                <br>How They Are Used
                <br>Python is a favorite for mathematicians and scientists who like to run algorithms and physics programs for lab testing and work. It has also become dominant in web development, machine learning, desktop GUI creation, software development, rapid prototyping, video game design, and enterprise-level applications.

                <br>PHP is used primarily for the creation of web-based applications and web pages. It has also been used to create GUI-based apps, form data representation, create flash elements, and build e-commerce applications.

                <br>Access logging	
                <br>Predefined error reporting	
                <br>Python vs PHP: Which is Better?
                <br>Before the 2020s, PHP was an easy pick for a better web development language. In the 2020s, Python has made gallops and leaps forward. As PHP suffers from faults in stack overflow and content scaling, Python is slowly being fine-tuned to take over.

                <br>It has already taken the lead for general purpose applications over Java, C, and C++. That’s not to say that it will replace PHP. As it stands, PHP is still better for server-side script and web development. However, learning Python can lead to a wider variety of opportunities than just web development applications.

                <br>If you’re stuck in the decision between learning the two, I would recommend going with Python. While many have claimed that both are easy to learn, Python is still simpler than PHP. It is also a more future-proof decision. As network technology continues to advance, the technical capabilities of web applications will change.
