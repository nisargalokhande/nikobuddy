               <br>When starting a new development project, it can be difficult to decide which programming language is the best fit. JavaScript is a popular language that is often the first one learned by developers. However, a growing number of professionals are embracing the features of JavaScript’s relative, TypeScript.

               <br>Because TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, the two languages share many similarities in terms of syntax. However, the differences in TypeScript stem from the fact that Microsoft developed this language to help programmers create large, complex projects. Understanding the pros and cons of the two programming languages will improve the performance when utilizing either or both of them in a project.

               <br>TypeScript vs JavaScript: Side-by-Side Comparison
               <br>TypeScript	JavaScript
               <br>First version:	2012	1995
               <br>Developer:	Microsoft	Netscape
               <br>Skill-level:	Requires experience	Entry-level coding
               <br>Typing style:	Static	Dynamic
               <br>Requires compiler:	Yes	No
               <br>Inheritance:	Classes	Prototypes
               <br>TypeScript vs JavaScript: Four Must-Know Facts
               <br>JavaScript is a scripting language known to web developers around the world.
               <br>TypeScript is an expansion, or superset, of JavaScript.
               <br>TypeScript uses a compiler to generate JavaScript code.
               <br>TypeScript uses static typing to improve accuracy in complex projects.
               <br>JavaScript: Fundamental Web Development Language
               <br>Introduced by Netscape in 1995, JavaScript is one of the fundamental languages of web development. Most interactive websites use JavaScript as a basic building because it runs directly on most browsers. As a scripting language, JavaScript offers fast performance for simple front-end tasks.

               <br>The world of this language is also full of supportive tools like libraries and frameworks. Experienced programmers can use JQuery or Angular to improve their sites and simplify their programming. The age of the language also means that there are many seasoned JS programmers around. Asking a JS question on a site like Stack Overflow will give developers plenty of answers.

               <br>When students first learn web development, they are primarily concerned with creating sites with interactive features. JavaScript is perfect for this kind of front-end development. However, programming for the back end can be more challenging with this language. Although developers can use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side tasks, they often switch to newer languages like TypeScript for more efficient back-end programming.

               <br>TypeScript: Expanding the Capabilities of JavaScript
               <br>As more programmers began to build back-end structures with JavaScript, they realized the limitations of this language. In 2012, Microsoft introduced TypeScript as a way to expand on the features of JavaScript. They hoped that the new compiled language would empower developers to take on more complicated projects.

               <br>TypeScript is an expanded version of JavaScript. It follows the ECMAScript Syntax 2015. Compiling a TypeScript program results in JavaScript code. One of the advantages of this programming language is that developers can run JavaScript as TypeScript without any conflicts. This feature allows programmers to use JS for components while creating a complex structure with TS.

               <br>The pros and cons of TypeScript represent its unique niche in the programming world. While the number of developers using the language is increasing, a search on a developer site like Stack Overflow will result in more hits for pure JavaScript than TypeScript. Because it uses a compiler, setting up TS on a local computer can create some challenges for a new programmer. However, several popular IDEs have introduced TypeScript specific resources on their platforms.

               <br>The similarities between TypeScript and JavaScript offer several advantages for advanced programmers. Because TypeScript derives from JavaScript, TS programmers can use most JS libraries as part of their projects without any trouble. They can also bundle older JS programs into their current TS code.

               <br>The differences between the two languages also bring benefits. Features like static typing and type checking increase the accuracy of a developer’s code. They will spend less time debugging large projects because the TS compiler automatically throws exceptions ahead of runtime.

               <br>TypeScript vs JavaScript: Which One Should You Use?
               <br>The pros and cons of choosing TypeScript over JavaScript are typically a matter of scale. Smaller projects do not need the robust resources of TypeScript. For a new programmer, setting up and learning TypeScript on a local computer does not bring the immediate rewards of running a JavaScript program through a browser.

               <br>However, experienced programmers will appreciate the expanded features that TypeScript brings to complex projects. This programming language will empower developers as they move from the client-side to the server-side without performance issues. TypeScript is a helpful resource for full-stack development.

               <br>TypeScript vs JavaScript: Which is Best? FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) 
               <br>What is TypeScript vs JavaScript?

               <br>These two languages share several similarities. JavaScript is one of the fundamental languages of web development. TS is an expanded cousin of JS designed for more complex projects.

               <br>When do I use TypeScript vs JavaScript?

               <br>Developers may want to choose TypeScript as their projects become more complex. The structural syntax and static typing of TS help prevent errors in large programs.

               <br>One of the differences between TS and JS is that TS uses a compiler while JS is a scripted language. Programs that run directly from a browser are simpler to handle with JS.

               <br>Is TypeScript easier than JavaScript?

               <br>Most developers find that JavaScript is an easier program to set up and learn than TypeScript. In addition, there is more support for JavaScript on resources like Stack Overflow than TypeScript due to the larger population of JS experts.

               <br>Is TypeScript different than JavaScript?

               <br>There are many similarities between TS and JS. However, TypeScript is an expansion of the older program. TS is a compiled language, and JS is a scripted language that runs directly in a browser.

               <br>The two programming languages also treat typing in different ways. The static typing of TS prevents errors that JS’s dynamic typing might permit.

               <br>Will TypeScript replace JavaScript?

               <br>TypeScript is becoming more popular for enterprise-level projects. However, JavaScript will remain relevant as both a learning tool and a language for smaller projects.

               <br>Which one has more features: TypeScript or JavaScript?

               <br>TypeScript has more features than JavaScript. The language can work with JS frameworks and libraries. It also has structural features such as support for interfaces and generics that make it a better fit for complicating coding projects.
