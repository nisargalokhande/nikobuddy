                Google Sites SEO

Google has created nearly 300 tools and products, and one of the most little-known is a website builder called “Google Sites.” The web application, found at sites.google.com, is part of the larger Google suite of content creation tools.
When compared with other content management systems (CMS) like WordPress and Wix, Google Sites has limited web design functionality, but this doesn’t mean it’s ineffective. Despite its limited features, new websites on this platform can compete on search engine results pages (SERPs) using Google Sites SEO (search engine optimization).
Turn rankings into revenue

What is Google Sites SEO?


Google Sites SEO is a digital marketing strategy used to make your Google Sites website more visible to search engine users. Improving your site with SEO can boost the ranking of your website on search engine results pages, and a higher ranking is correlated with more search traffic.
Since a third of global web traffic comes from search engines, even a small boost in ranking can mean significantly more traffic. A few popular SEO techniques that are effective for business websites include:
laiming a Google My Business page (great for small business SEO)
Adding schema makeup to generate rich snippets
Using HTML meta tags
Creating custom domain names that are memorable
But these aren’t the only tactics Google Sites users can employ to improve their search engine rankings. In no particular order, here are 8 that are proven to drive search traffic from Google.
Submit an XML sitemap to Google
An XML sitemap acts as a blueprint of your website. When search engines have this blueprint, they can analyze and rank (a process known as crawling and indexing) content more accurately and efficiently. The indexing process is important because it determines which categories and search terms your content will show up for on results pages.
You can submit an XML sitemap to Google Search Console (formerly known as Google Webmaster Tools) so that crawlers have it for reference. This is also where you can check your indexing status and see areas of improvement.
Start with keyword research
Keyword research is how you decide what topics your content will focus on. During this process, you will research specific subjects in your niche. The goal will be to find terms related to your business that people are typing into search engines.
There are many free tools that help you find a search term or keyword phrase that will work well for your niche. The Moz Keyword Explorer and Neil Patel’s Ubersuggest research tools are two excellent options. Google Trends is another great resource you can use: It can reveal interest in a search term by region, country, state, or worldwide. It can also show a keyword’s popularity over time and gives you suggestions for related topics.
Create valuable content
Quality content is one of the driving forces behind a well-executed SEO strategy. The more advanced Google gets, the better it is at evaluating the value of content to its visitors. So what makes content valuable?
Valuable content answers whatever search query it ranks for, a phenomenon known as “satisfying user intent.” To provide value, try and think of how you can expand on the current content for a subject.
Determine the best approach by researching top-ranking posts and seeing what format, information, and style is highly-valued for the topic. By adopting some of these elements and looking for ways to add unique elements of your own, you will show search engine crawlers how your content builds on the current selection.
Creating valuable content also means making it easy to consume. Here are several ways to improve readability and engagement:
Use headers to break up sections
Create infographics for social media
Include FAQ sections
Add a social sharing sidebar for Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.
When you create a new page on your website, think of its goal and the user’s goal, and determine how you can create content to satisfy both.
